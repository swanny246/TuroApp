This is a bot that will monitor Poketwo channels that utilise PokeName or Poketox for tracking shiny hunts, collection hunts, rare pings and regional pings.

If it sees a hunt, it will go ahead and lock the channel for you so the mon won't flee! Run the main.py file to get going, your bot token goes in a config.json file.

Powered by Discord slash commands, so check the ``/set_`` commands for everything to set it all up.
